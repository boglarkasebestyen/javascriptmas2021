JavaScriptmas is a 24-day long, daily coding challenge organized by the Norwegian online coding school, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), starting from December 1st until December 24th, 2021. It strictly consists of JavaScript exercises, as its name suggests.

In this repository I'm committing all of my solutions to this year's exercises. My last year's submissions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/boglarkasebestyen/JavaScriptmas).

Scrimba's Advent Calendar containing all of the exercises can be found [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021).
